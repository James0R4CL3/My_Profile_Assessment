        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <hr> 
        <br> <br> <br> 
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>For my project I would like to make a website that would act 
            as a hub that my band mates and myself can use to access 
            assets of the band in an easy and well laid out way.<br> 
            It will be a good way to keep track of important dates and 
            information like<br> upcoming shows, tours, social media login 
            details, finance, practise material and set lists etc.<br> 
            It will be accessible online and offline on multiple 
            operating systems such as iOS, Android and windows <br>so that 
            no matter the device at hand, members will be able to have 
            access.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>The reason I have chosen to create this is that from my own 
            personal experience I have noticed that there is a large 
            need for a platform like this for bands.<br> It's easy to be 
            overwhelmed with information when in a band, and finding 
            that information can become a pain.<br> Having one place with 
            everything you need well laid out in front of you would 
            be a dream come true for myself and other people experiencing 
            the same issues in bands or personal projects.<br> Motivation is 
            a large factor in being a successful musician,<br> not being able 
            to find what you need to practice of do a press release makes 
            it all harder and makes it easier to put off.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This project will be a website that will have all that a band 
            could want in a organised, easy to navigate layout.<br>
            It will be your practice buddy, band planner and life saver 
            whilst being in a band. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>No more being asked things like:</h2>
        
        <br>
        <p>⦁	When is our next gig?<br> <br> 
            ⦁	What set list are we playing?<br><br> 
            ⦁	 Can someone send me the logo?<br><br> 
            ⦁	 What time do we need to be there?<br><br> 
            ⦁	What is the backline?<br><br> 
            ⦁	 When are we playing? <br><br> 
            </p>
        <br>
        <p>I could go on and on and on about questions I have been 
            asked that EVERYONE in the band should already know.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Any  band or musician can make an account and set limits to 
            the access other members will have if need be,<br> for instance, 
            if you have a session musician in the band and do not want 
            them to know all your social media login information or look 
            through your deal with a record label?<br> You can easily 
            restrict access, they won't even know its on the app.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Here are some helpful features this app will have:
        </h2>
        
        <p>⦁	 Upcoming shows, tours, meetings, interviews.
             Any event that you can imagine a band would need 
             to attend will be stored and, accessible for the 
             members, plus they will be reminded!<br><br>

            ⦁	 Practice material in the for of MP3's and Sheet 
            music or tablature to help the members keep on top of 
            their performance and be able to learn things they forget 
            or are not sure of.<br> The music will be avalable organised
             album by album, as a whole and have the ability to assign
              music to different set list playlists.<br> Have a 1-hour show 
              coming up? Or is it just a 30min set?<br> This will eliminate 
              confusion on what the members will be playing and when.<br><br>

            ⦁	Graphic design database of all promotional material for 
            the band, this includes merch designs for manufacturers,<br> 
            Logo files, band photos for promotion,<br> everything you could 
            need.<br><br>

            ⦁	 Details for logins for band accounts such as social
             media, Dropbox, band bank accounts and online stores 
             such as bandcamp etc.<br><br>

            ⦁	Financial Documentation on finance, how much has the band 
            spent? Who has contributed what amount to the band account?<br> 
            What has been paid for and when? All invoices and upcoming 
            financial commitments. <br><br>

            ⦁	Contracts for record labels and other contracts such as contracts for the members themselves or band endorsements.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>The project should be easy to use and avalable on phones, 
                tablets and PC's with offline support just in case you 
                do not have access to the internet,<br> you will still be 
                able to keep practicing and be able to access anything 
                that was avalable last time you were connected online.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This project will help bands be more efficient and cause 
                less 'band drama' and frustration that comes with dealing 
                with people that are no paying attention to important 
                information.<br> Instead of having to constantly provide the 
                same things to different people over and over again that 
                they should have themselves,<br> you will simply reminded them 
                to check the app. It really could be that simple, and it 
                will be that simple.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Toolds and Technology</h2>
            <p>This website would be user friendly on both mobiles and 
                PC's, it will have a visually pleasing design and layout
                 and have the user data stored on a server.
            </p>
            
            <p>To make a website such as this, here are some of the 
                things I would need to know:
            </p>
            <p>⦁	 Server scripting language such as PHP, Active.NET, 
                C# or Python to develop the back end of the website.<br><br>

                ⦁	 Website design languages such as HTML, CSS and JS
                 for the design and front end of the website.<br><br>

                ⦁	 Server side data base application to handle 
                requests such as logging in, accessing their data etc.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <p>Some of the skills that need to be required for a website 
                like this would be being able to create dynamic websites 
                using python, html, css and JS, also being able to create 
                a database for user data.<br> I do not think any special 
                hardware would be needed if I can run the server from a 
                cloud instead of from a computer at my house.<br> The feasibility 
                of this project is high, I think I would be able to learn the 
                skills to accomplish this project myself<br> or easily find team 
                members capable of completing required all of the tasks.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>If this project is successful it would make the day to 
                day life of being a musician or being in a band much
                 better,<br> it would eliminate petty arguments between 
                 members on who has what file or set list etc and would
                  make it easy for every person in the band to stay up 
                  to date on everything that is happening.<br> It will solve 
                  the problem of not being able to find needed 
                  information and make it all avalable to those who 
                  need it.<br> This would have an extremely positive impact 
                  on everyone involved in the band and make everyone
                   much more organised, improving motivation and quality 
                   of life.
