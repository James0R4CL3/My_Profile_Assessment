        <h2>My interest in I.T and when it started</h2>
        
        <p>My interest in I.T started when I was about 7 years old;
            I was given an awful laptop by today's standards from a
            family friend that didn't want it anymore.<br>
             It was old and
            slow but it could play music and 1 car game,that was
            enough to pique my interest.<br>
             I spent weeks going through
            all the setting and just learning everything I could 
            about how it worked.<br>
            <br>My current I.T interest is
            programming, gaming, sound engineering and graphic
            design.<br>
            Programming is a new-found passion for me,
            when I started this course I knew I wanted to work
            in the industry but I wasn't sure what I wanted to
            do exactly.<br>
            Since starting this course and learning 
            to code I have found myself really enjoying it and
            would love to work in software development
            someday.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Why I chose to study at RMIT</h2>

            <p>I chose RMIT because the I.T degree covers a lot of 
            different parts of I.T and I wanted to find exactly what 
            I would enjoy doing the most in I.T,<br>
            being able to study 
            such a broad amount of subjects seems like the best way for 
            me to learn more skills and find my passion in the field.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What I expect to learn during my studies</h2>

            <p>During my degree, I expect to learn a broad skill set and 
            also learn what I enjoy doing in I.T the most.<br>
            I will learn 
            how to study from home and learn more discipline to ensure I 
            stay on track with my progress.<br>
             I am very excited to learn 
            more about programming, web development and networking!
