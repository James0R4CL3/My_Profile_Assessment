        <p>The position to my understanding is leading a team of
            developers to improve and expand the company to help
            reach overseas markets.<br>
            Some responsibilities would be
            leading a team and mentoring members,<br>
            checking and testing
            code done by the team and writing my own code for the
            team also, sounds like an awesome job! 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>This job sounds appealing to me because I love working and
            leading teams, I have experience leading people and working
            in a team and with teams.<br>
            I love the idea of working with 
            others so achieve tasks, regardless of the task at hand, 
            finding efficient and useful ways to get things done.<br> 
            Working from home is a huge plus for me and also it's a 
            good paying job!<br>
            I would love to work doing something 
            like this because I love the idea of leading/working with 
            a team,<br>
            this would be a great example of my ideal job one 
            day!
        </p>      
        <br>
        <p>The ad does not list any specific qualifications but I assume 
            as degree in IT would be expected for this skill level. <br>

            Skills I would need for this position would be experience 
            and strong skills in communicating with people. <br>
             I would need 
            skills and experience in conflict resolution and being able 
            to clearly and properly communicate ideas and concepts to a 
            team. <br>
            I would need to have a very good understanding and 
            experience with programming in Python as the job seems to 
            be very Python centered, <br>
             also experience with web frameworks 
            like React. <br>
            Being self-motivated and able to productively 
            work from home would be a must in any kind of job like this, <br>
            especially whilst leading a team, you must not slack off - 
            they could all be waiting on you!
        </p>  
        <br>
        <p>Skill I currently have that would help with a role such as 
        this is experience working in teams and being a team leader, <br>

        I have 5+ years experience leading a band of 5 people including 
        myself. <br>
        It is considerably more difficult leading people without 
        the incentive of salary, requiring invoking a lot of excitement. <br> 
        I have built a website on WIX for my last employer, it was an 
        ecommerce web page that allowed users to view and place hire 
        orders or purchase equipment via the site.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>A plan for obtaining the skills required for this job would 
            be to finish this degree. <br>
            I think this degree would help me 
            to learn more of the skills required for a role like this. <br>

            I need to gain more skill in programming in python, I have 
            only just begun my journey & am anticipating a long, <br>

            interesting and challenging path. I would also need more 
            skills in working with web frameworks, <br>
            learn more languages such as React and Angular, I know nothing about these and 
            look forward to learning more. <br>
            More experience using GitHub would be helpful, I have used it 
            quite a bit already after being introduced to it during this 
            course but I feel like there is room for improvement. <br>            
            It would be a good idea to improve my leadership skills,
            honing and acquiring new skills and proficiencies as I
            progress.
