    <h2>16Personalities Results</h2>

    <p>For this test I got Advocate Personality INFJ-A/INFJ-T. <br>
    My interpretation of the results of this test are that I am 
    somebody that care deeply about other people's well-being and 
    that my desire for success can outweigh my immediate personal needs.<br> 
    The results say that my personality type is very creative, principled, 
    passionate but sensitive to criticism, prone to burning out and a 
    perfectionist.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I think that this test is quite accurate to how I feel I am as a 
    person, I often over work myself striving for perfection.<br> 
    I have found that in the past with personal projects that I have 
    worked on this striving for perfection to the point that they never 
    get finished because I feel like they could always be better.<br> 
    I struggle to decided when things are good enough and it's something 
    I try and stay conscious of. <br>
    I am also very sensitive to criticism,
    although I really do appreciate it, it still makes me feel like I 
    could have done better and that I should have spent more time working 
    on whatever it was. <br>
     This often makes my habit of working on things 
    till burnout worse, so I try my best to accept that my work was not 
    perfect and strive to do better in the future. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I believe that based on these results my I would work well in a 
    team, yes I struggle with criticism on my work, <br> but I am rarely 
    hostile in response to it, rather I just feel like I should have 
    spent more time on it and done better. <br> I feel that my need to make
    sure everyone is happy and that I always try to make things better 
    would be a helpful trait to have in a team working enviroment.<br> 
    This could have a negative effect on a team if I try too hard to 
    make something perfect or to make someone happy.<br> Some times spending 
    too long on something to try and make it perfect doesn't work and I
    get stuck in a rabbit hole of thought going over the same things time <br> 
    and time again just to find that the result is only marginally better 
    than my first work.<br> Also, trying to make sure everyone is happy can 
    be a bad thing,<br> making someone happy can make someone else unhappy 
    and can just start a paradox of issues within the team,<br> sometimes 
    I have to remind myself just to say my piece and leave it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>When forming a team I should take into account that I tend to be 
        a perfectionist with my work and let my teammates know this from 
        the start,<br> let them know to pull me up on stuff like that if I 
        take too long on trying to get some just right.<br> It would be a 
        good idea to team up with people that understand where I am 
        coming from and that can let me know that they are happy with 
        my work or provide details critical feedback <br> when they feel 
        there are things I missed or that need improvement as I take 
        critical feedback seriously and I need to know exactly how to 
        improve.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>A critique of the validity of the results of this test is that 
        with criticism it says that I handle it poorly,<br> whilst I actually 
        handle it pretty well, it implies that I can't take critical 
        feedback or that i respond poorly to it which is not true.<br> Yes, 
        critical feedback for me gets to me but it does so in a constructive 
        way, I get upset yes,<br> but I only get upset that I didn't do a better 
        job and I use the feedback to try and improve my work and do better 
        in the future.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Learning Style Results</h2>
    <p>For this test I got the Auditory/Visual learner. I completely agree 
        with this test, I learn best when I can watch someone do something 
        that I am trying to do.<br> I have learned most of my skills from 
        watching videos of people doing the activity on YouTube or being 
        shown something in person.<br> I struggle to learn things from just 
        reading or being told what to do, I can't spell things out loud 
        for some reason,<br> I always need to look at the word to see if it 
        looks correct to me. <br>This test claims that I am all these things, 
        I tend to colour code things and find it useful to draw up my ideas 
        and concepts on paper <br>rather than just try and talk it out or keep 
        it in my head. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I think in a team this could be good and bad depending on the 
        communication style of my team.<br> I find that if someone explains 
        something to me I find it hard to understand but if they 
        demonstrate something and I can see it in action that i 
        understand much easier.<br> With programming, when someone explains 
        something to me, it is a lot easier for me to understand if they 
        give me a simple example of what they are explaining and why it 
        works the way it does,<br> this may be a lot to ask from a team 
        member as it takes up more of their time but could also be a good 
        thing if my team member enjoys this style of presenting information.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>A critique of the validity of the results of this test is that 
        it says I am a Auditory learner,<br> whilst this is somewhat true I 
        struggle to learn things solely based off being told or listening 
        to something.<br> I find if I am being told something I need to ask a 
        lot of questions about it for it to make sense to me unless it is 
        perfectly explained in great detail from the start.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Creativity Test</h2>
    <p>For my third test I chose a creativity test because I consider
         myself somewhat creative, so I was interested in seeing what 
         the results would be.<br> My results from this test gave me a 
         creativity score of 83.29 compared to a typical result of 62.99.<br> 
         The test says i score high in boldness and curiosity, agree with 
         these results.<br> I find myself looking for new and better ways to 
         complete tasks and create systems to make thing easier, faster and 
         more accurate.<br> I often think about other ways I could get things 
         done and a lot of the time when I am doing something I often think 
         that there must be a better way to do it,<br> even if I can't figure 
         out what that way is myself. 
         <br>
         <p>I think these traits would be good in a team enviroment 
             because I would look for better ways to do things and try 
             and make things easier for myself and my team.<br> A negative 
             impact this could have in a team enviroment is that I could 
             cause frustration if someone<br> believed that they already had 
             the best way of doing something figurered out or if 
             people were not open-minded to change,<br> it has happened 
             before at my last job.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>A critique of the validity of the results of this test is 
            that I personally think I should have scored a bit higher 
            in other areas such as persistence.<br> I tend to be very 
            persistent in creativity,<br> I find myself spending hours 
            and hours on tasks and when things feel like they are 
            getting too hard and that I want to quit,<br> I don't quit, 
            I end up getting to the point of wanting to give up then 
            find myself coming straight back to it and spending all 
            night on the task till I get much better.
